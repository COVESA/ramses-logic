v0.2.0

------------------
Bugfixes
------------------

* Fixed a bug with recent sol and Visual Studio 16.7.4

    * Only a workaround, until properly fixed in sol + MSVS
    * Results in minor mismatch in reported errors when using VECx types
    * Errors are still readable and have a stack trace, just the message is different

------------------
Features
------------------

* Improved class hierarchy:

    * All binding-classes inherit from RamsesBinding
    * Scripts and RamsesBinding inherit from LogicNode
    * Can call destroy(LogicNode&) for all object types now

* RamsesAppearanceBinding class for manipulation of RAMSES appearances.
* Linking of outputs of LogicNodes to inputs of other LogicNodes, with some limitations:

    * No checks for cycles yet
    * Must link struct properties one-by-one
    * Some error checks missing (see API docs of link())
    * LogicNode has "isLinked" function for checking if a LogicNode is linked

* Iterators and collections to iterate over objects of LogicEngine class
* Saving and loading of LogicEngine to and from files
* Upgrade to Ramses v.26.0.4 (from v25.0.6)
* Added API to obtain version of ramses logic
* Added CMake option to disable installation of Ramses Logic

    * Does not affect ramses installation (Ramses has no such option yet)
    * Sol doesn't support disabling of installation - Sol headers are still installed

* Improved documentation

------------------

* Remove flatbuffers targets from build
