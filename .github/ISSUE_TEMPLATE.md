For error reports, please:

1. Write a test (use any existing file in /src/test/ or create a new one there)
2. Use googletest mechanics to describe what you expect, and make sure the test fails on your developer setup first
3. Ideally, try to make the test fail on one of the supported GitHub Actions workflows
4. If the above steps are not applicable, explain why, and give in-depth error and environment description:
    - is the error reproducible?
    - in which circumstances is the error/crash/bug triggered?
    - which compiler/IDE are you using? What are their versions?
    - Environment variables?
    - Do you use different versions of the external dependencies?

If you want to request a feature:

1. Describe your use-case and what you need the feature for if possible
2. Give us pseudo-code of how you expect the feature to work.
3. Use either asserts, or google tests, in combination with comments to demonstrate what behavior you expect
