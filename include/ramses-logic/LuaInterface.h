    * LuaInterface encapsulates forms an additional layer to a logic network (whole or its parts) and it exposes only relevant
    * inputs to the user of that network. Those input variables can be used to represent scenes in an abstract way.
    * LuaInterface instances are created by the #rlogic::LogicEngine class.
    *
    * A LuaInterface can be created from Lua source code which must fulfill same requirements as #rlogic#LuaScript, except for the following:
    *
    * - A Lua interface contains only one global function: interface()
    * - The interface() function takes only one parameter that represents both inputs and outputs, e.g., interface(INOUT_PARAMS)
    *
    * Violating any of these requirements will result in errors, which can be obtained by calling
    * #rlogic::LogicEngine::getErrors().
    * For other than interface definition purposes, see #rlogic::LuaModule and #rlogic::LuaScript for details.
    *
    * See also the full documentation at https://ramses-logic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html for more details on Lua and
    * its interaction with C++.
