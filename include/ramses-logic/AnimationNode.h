    * Animation node can be used to animate properties in logic network.
    * Animation node itself is a logic node and has a set of input and output properties:
    * - Fixed inputs:
    *     - progress (float)  - point within [0;1] normalized range of where to jump to in the animation
    *                         - in this range 0 marks the time 0 (regardless of timestamp of the first keyframe),
    *                           and 1 marks the end of the animation determined by the duration of the animation
    *                         - values outside of the [0;1] range are accepted and will be clamped
    * - Fixed outputs:
    *     - duration (float)  - total duration of the animation, determined by the highest timestamp from all its channels
    *                         - is affected by modifications to timestamp data via properties
    *                           (see #rlogic::AnimationNodeConfig::setExposingOfChannelDataAsProperties)
    *
    * - Channel outputs: Each animation channel provided at creation time (#rlogic::LogicEngine::createAnimationNode)
    *                    will be represented as output property with name of the channel (#rlogic::AnimationChannel::name)
    *                    and a value of type matching element in #rlogic::AnimationChannel::keyframes.
    *                    Channel value output is a result of keyframes interpolation based on the 'progress' input above,
    *                    it can be linked to another logic node input to use the animation result.
    *
    * - Channel data inputs (only if created with #rlogic::AnimationNodeConfig::setExposingOfChannelDataAsProperties enabled):
    *     - channelsData (struct) - contains all channels and their data in a hierarchy. For each channel:
    *         - [channelName] (struct)
    *             - timestamps (array of float) - each element represents a timestamp value
    *             - keyframes (array of T) - each element represents a keyframe value
    *                                      - type T is data type matching this channel original keyframes
    *
    * During update when 'progress' input is set the following logic is executed:
    *     - calculate local animation time based on progress
    *     - for each channel:
    *         - lookup closest previous and next timestamp/keyframe pair according to the local animation time,
    *         - interpolate between them according to the interpolation type of that channel,
    *         - and finally set this value to the channel's output property.
    *
    * Note that all channel outputs will always have a value determined by corresponding keyframes, this includes
    * also when the time falls outside of the first/last animation timestamps:
    *     - channel output value equals first keyframe for any time at or before the first keyframe timestamp
    *     - channel output value equals last keyframe for any time at or after the last keyframe timestamp
    * This can be useful for example when needing to initialize the outputs before playing the animation yet,
    * when updating the animation node with progress 0, the logic will execute and update outputs to their
    * first keyframes.
