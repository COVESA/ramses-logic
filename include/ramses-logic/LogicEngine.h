        /**
        * A weak link is for the most part equivalent to #link - it has the same requirements and data propagation behavior,
        * but with one crucial difference. Weak link is not considered for node dependency graph (logic node topology)
        * which determines the order of nodes execution during #update. This allows to form a cycle using weak link
        * within the dependency graph, which can be helpful when some feedback data is required (e.g. a controller
        * node managing a worker node using normal links, worker node reports progress back to controller via weak link).
        * However there are important things to consider to avoid unexpected problems:
        *   1. The value propagated from a weak link is old, it is the value that was calculated in previous #update.
        *      Example: consider A->B->C using normal links and a back loop C->A using weak link. When #update is called,
        *               the nodes are executed exactly in the order defined by normal link dependency: A, B, C (remember
        *               that weak links are not considered for execution order). This means however that when A is executed
        *               its input value from weak linked C is only from previous update because C is executed last.
        *   2. During first update (after creation or load from file) there is no value applied from weak link, instead
        *      the initial input property value will be used at the weak link target. This is a logical consequence of the
        *      limitation described above - during first update there was no previous update and therefore no value from weak link.
        *   3. Avoid infinite update loops - #update has an optimization to execute only nodes with modified inputs,
        *      this can greatly simplify update of complex node hierarchies. When using weak links there is a risk that
        *      there will be a never ending need of executions of nodes involved in a node graph cycle. Consider the last
        *      node providing new value via weak link to first node, which then generates again new value propagated
        *      to the last node, this will result in the need to execute those nodes in all upcoming #update calls.
